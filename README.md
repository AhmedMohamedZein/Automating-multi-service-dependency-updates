# Automating-multi-service-dependency-updates
This script streamlines the process of updating shared dependencies across multiple services within a distributed or microservices-based architecture. It automatically detects outdated packages or modules, applies consistent version updates across designated repositories, and can optionally trigger build pipelines or create pull requests.
